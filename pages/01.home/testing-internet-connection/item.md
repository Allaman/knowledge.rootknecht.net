I recently switched from a prehistoric 16 mbit/s DSL connection to a 1000 mbit/s cable connection. Of course, I was curious how much bandwidth actually is available for me. Therefore, I wrote some simple and not so sophisticated python lines to answer this question by using the awesome [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) module and some basic `matplotlib`.
