## htop

[htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/) is a enhanced version of `top` which comes preinstalled on most systems.
- *P* &rarr; sort by CPU
- *M* &rarr; sort by memory usage
- *F4* &rarr; filter processes by string
- *space* &rarr; mark a single process

Settings are stored in `$HOME/.config/htop/htoprc` but overwritten by the application by pressing `F10` save and exit.
