## Two x60 getting one

The x60 is the last thinkpad model with the IBM branding so I had to get one. Unfortunately, there was only a model with a Intel Core Duo processor with a 32-bit architecture. That's a drawback due to the fact that most modern Linux distributions dropped i386 support which complicates my idea of operating the x60 as a daily driver alternative to my x230.

Luckily, a co-worker sold me a x60 tablet model running a Intel Core **2** Duo processor with a 64-bit architecture

## Backing a motherboard

## Replacing x230 keyboard

Unfortunately, my x230 was the first model with the new chiclet style keyboard which is still very good in comparison to other brands but the classic x220 keyboard was far more comfortable in my opinion. Luckily Thinkpads of this era could be easily disambled and parts swaped out.

I stumbled over a nice tutorial on [install a classic keyboard on a xx30 series thinkpad](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Install_Classic_Keyboard_on_xx30_Series_ThinkPads).

I ordered the following parts at ebay:
-  Lenovo **45N2153** Tastatur Deutsch f√ºr Thinkpad T410 T420 T510 T520 W510 W520 for 60 Euros
-  Lenovo Thinkpad X220 X220i X220s Palmrest Plastic Cover **04W1410 H44** (with fingerprint cut out) for 16 Euros

! Be aware that the classic keyboard does not have the backlight feature
