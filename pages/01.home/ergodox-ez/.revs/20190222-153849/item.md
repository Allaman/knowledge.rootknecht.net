# ErgoDox EZ thinkings

Thinkings about my new keyboard: the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) and my journey to use it.

## Ordering

I ordered the ErgoDox EZ Glow model that comes with backlighted keys in black and Cherry MX brown switches. Addtionally, I ordered the wrist wings for more typing comfort. It took thirteen days to build(!) and deliver from Taiwan via UPS and there was no issue with german customs. 

##  Onboxing

The keyboard and the wings came in a two minimalstic but elegant black boxes

The wing's box contains the two wrist wings which seem to be very sturdy and heavier then I thought

The keyboard's box contains the two pieces of the keyboard a TRRS cable to connect with each other and a USB Type B cable to connect the right halve to a device. Additionally, a caps/switch removal tool, F/J caps without nubs, and six washers to disable the clicks for the tilt/tent legs allowing infinite adjustability

The two halves of the board in their natural beauty. Note the six legs which allow to adjust the angle in all directions
