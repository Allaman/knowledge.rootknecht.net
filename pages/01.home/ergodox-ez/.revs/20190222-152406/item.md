# ErgoDox EZ thinkings

Thinkings about my new keyboard: the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) and my journey to use it.

## Ordering

I ordered the ErgoDox EZ Glow model that comes with backlighted keys in black and Cherry MX brown switches. Addtionally, I ordered the wrist wings for more typing comfort. It took thirteen days to deliver from Taiwan via UPS and there was no issue with german customs. 

##  Onboxing

The keyboard and the wings came in a two minimalstic but elegant black boxes
