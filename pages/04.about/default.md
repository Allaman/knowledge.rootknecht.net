## Why knowledge.rootknecht.net?

The intention behind this page is that I can remember things I discovered during my journey and to share my experience and tricks I made with you. In my opinion, to share solutions and hints is at least as satisfying as to disvocer or develop them on your own.

I structured the topics in the folowing five categories:

- [Application](https://knowledge.rootknecht.net/taxonomy?name=category&val=Application)

    Everything related to applications, e.g their installation, configuration, or usage

- [DevOps](https://knowledge.rootknecht.net/taxonomy?name=category&val=DevOps)

    Tools and techniques in the area of DevOps, e.g. automation and infrastructure setup of linux and containerized environments

- [Linux](https://knowledge.rootknecht.net/taxonomy?name=category&val=Linux)

    Experience from my Linux usage in the past decade, both on the server and on the client side

- [Personal](https://knowledge.rootknecht.net/taxonomy?name=category&val=Personal)

    Personal stuff or opinions and other non categorized articles

- [Programming](https://knowledge.rootknecht.net/taxonomy?name=category&val=Programming)

    Some hints on different programming topics I dealt with
